WRITEPODS help creators get actionable feedback on eliterature works in progress. Use this initial recipe and modify it to make it your own.


Initial documents are from the 2021 WRITEPOD experiment.

Moderators: Deena Larsen, Lyle Skains, Jules Chatelain

Participants agreed to and attended two meetings in March and April 2021. Some of the participants will be reporting on what happened at the ELO 2021 (virtual) conference in May 2021.
